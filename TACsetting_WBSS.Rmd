## Current TAC setting in Subdivision 22-24
> See COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2019/1838 of 30 October 2019 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/124 as regards certain fishing opportunities in other waters.

In October, TAC is agreed for subdivision 22-24 following the EU multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea. 
This TAC concerns the F-fleet and is attributed totally to WBSS so: $TAC_{22-24}=TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ 

In `r thisY`, $TAC_{F_{WBSS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACf)` t**.



## Current TAC setting in the North Sea

TO FILL for A and B fleet


## Current TAC setting in Division 3.a
> See AGREED RECORD OF CONCLUSIONS OF FISHERIES CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN NORWAY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE REGULATION OF FISHERIES IN SKAGERRAK AND KATTEGAT FOR 2020

In december, TAC for division 3.a is agreed between the EU and Norway and depends on the TAC setting adopted during the 2014 Working Group on management measures for herring in the Skagerrak and Kattegat.

1. $TAC_{WBSS}=2TAC_{22-24}=2TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ so in `r thisY`, $TAC_{WBSS}=$ **`r displayNum(2*TACf)` t**.

<span style="color:red"> VB: Note that as long as agreed TAC equal the advice the two are approx interchangable, but if the two begin to depart, it is relevant to make a distinction  </span>

2. Assuming 1. and given the TAC for the A-fleet in the North Sea $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$, $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ for human consumption in 3.a is calculated as $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}=0.41TAC_{WBSS} + 0.057TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$.

<span style="color:red"> VT: I assume the $0.057TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ may correspond to the part of the C-fleet catch that is NSAS herring. The $0.41TAC_{WBSS}$ could correspond to the part of the C-fleet catch that is WBSS herring. </span>

Since $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACa_NSWB)` t** in `r thisY`, $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(round(TACc_NSWB))` t**. 

3. 50% of Norwegian $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ can be taken in the Norwegian Economic Zone and 50% of EU $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ can be taken in the North Sea so added to $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$

4. Then the TAC for the industrial and sprat bycatch fisheries in 3.a (D-flieet) is given. In `r thisY`, $TAC_{D_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACd_NSWB)` t**. 

<!-- <span style="color:red"> VT: Do you know where this number comes from?  </span> -->


5. Thereafter, at HAWG, we take our own assumptions to split the above TACs in 3.a between WBSS and NSAS as follows:



```{r include=FALSE}
url_dir=paste0("https://www.stockassessment.org/datadisk/stockassessment/userdirs/user295/WBSS_HAWG_",thisY,"/") # URL of assessment directory
url_forecast <- paste0(url_dir, "run/forecast.RData")
load(url(url_forecast)) # load an object called FC 

TACfleet <- attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby[which(rownames(attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby)==as.character(thisY)),seq(1,ncol(attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby),3)]
TAC <- sum(TACfleet)

TACNSWB <- c(385008, 24528, 6659, 3150) # TAC given for herring in North Sea and western Baltic
#catch_all <- apply(catchthisY[,(ncol(catchthisY)-(sum(fitthisY$data$fleetTypes==0)-1)):ncol(catchthisY)],1,sum)
#prop_C <- catchthisY[(fitthisY$data$noYears-2):fitthisY$data$noYears,which(colnames(catchthisY)=="Obs(Fleet w.o. effort 3)")]
propWB_C <- 0.7284 # 3-year average split
propWB_D <- 0.3381 # 3-year average split
utiliz_C <- 0.50 # given by Pelagic RAC
utiliz_D <- 0.0547 # 3 years average utilization
options(scipen=999)
star.symbol='&#42;'
```

<span style="color:red"> VT: So in conclusion, the way the TAC is set for WBSS assumes that 50% of $TAC_{WBSS}$ is taken by the F-fleet, 41% is taken by the C-fleet and 9% is taken by the D- and A-fleets. If this is the correct interpretation of the TAC setting, looking at the Table above, we see that this is not currently valid. Assuming the fleet utilization, we have $TAC_{A_{WBSS}}$ = `r round(TACfleet[1]/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{C_{WBSS}}$ = `r round((utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2])/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{D_{WBSS}}$ = `r round((utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3])/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ = `r round(TACNSWB[4]/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%.
I don't understand the rule $TAC_{WBSS}=2TAC_{22-24}$ when it is not actually the case. </span>

<span style="color:red"> VB: this confirms that the 3a TAC setting rule is flawed, but we knew that. Also back in time the rule was known to be unprecautionary for the WBSS unless of a transfer of the C-fleet to the North Sea of at least 10%. Nowadays even with a 50% transfer the 3a TAC setting rule generates a considerable overshooting of whatever could be a possible advice for the stock. Other important considerations:
1. The proportion of WBSS in the catches of the A, C and D fleet is quite variable but I'm not aware of any particular trend (still, it would be good to have a closer look at the time series of mixing)
2. having a constant $TAC_{D_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ seems inappropriate for a stock which has been decreasing so badly but luckly the utilization is so low that it is not the cause of the problem here
3. $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ and how it gets into the definition of the $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ ($~0.057TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$) are the real issues. The impact of this term is both direct and indirect with WBSS catches taken by the A-fleet and the C-fleet.
So with an advice which has been progressively shrinking for the WBSS but not for the NSAS, it should be no surprise that the resulting catches of WBSS in 3a + North Sea well exceed 50% of the advice for this stock   </span>
