## Current TAC setting in Subdivision 22-24
> See COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2019/1838 of 30 October 2019 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/124 as regards certain fishing opportunities in other waters.

In October, TAC is agreed for subdivision 22-24 following the EU multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea. 
This TAC concerns the F-fleet and is attributed totally to WBSS so: $TAC_{22-24}=TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ 

In `r thisY`, $TAC_{F_{WBSS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACf)` t**.



## Current TAC setting in the North Sea

TO FILL for A and B fleet


## Current TAC setting in Division 3.a
> See AGREED RECORD OF CONCLUSIONS OF FISHERIES CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN NORWAY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE REGULATION OF FISHERIES IN SKAGERRAK AND KATTEGAT FOR 2020

In december, TAC for division 3.a is agreed between the EU and Norway and depends on the TAC setting adopted during the 2014 Working Group on management measures for herring in the Skagerrak and Kattegat.

1. $TAC_{WBSS}=2TAC_{22-24}=2TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ so in `r thisY`, $TAC_{WBSS}=$ **`r displayNum(2*TACf)` t**.

<span style="color:red"> VB: Note that as long as agreed TAC equal the advice the two are approx interchangable, but if the two begin to depart, it is relevant to make a distinction  </span>

2. Assuming 1. and given the TAC for the A-fleet in the North Sea $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$, $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ for human consumption in 3.a is calculated as $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}=0.41TAC_{WBSS} + 0.057TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$.

<span style="color:red"> VT: I assume the $0.057TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ may correspond to the part of the C-fleet catch that is NSAS herring. The $0.41TAC_{WBSS}$ could correspond to the part of the C-fleet catch that is WBSS herring.  </span>

Since $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACa_NSWB)` t** in `r thisY`, $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(round(TACc_NSWB))` t**. 

3. 50% of Norwegian $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ can be taken in the Norwegian Economic Zone and 50% of EU $TAC_{C_{WBSS+NSAS}}$ can be taken in the North Sea so added to $TAC_{A_{WBSS+NSAS}}$

4. Then the TAC for the industrial and sprat bycatch fisheries in 3.a (D-flieet) is given. In `r thisY`, $TAC_{D_{WBSS+NSAS}}=$ **`r displayNum(TACd_NSWB)` t**. 


5. Thereafter, at HAWG, we take our own assumptions to split the above TACs in 3.a between WBSS and NSAS as follows:



```{r include=FALSE}
url_dir=paste0("https://www.stockassessment.org/datadisk/stockassessment/userdirs/user295/WBSS_HAWG_",thisY,"/") # URL of assessment directory
url_forecast <- paste0(url_dir, "run/forecast.RData")
load(url(url_forecast)) # load an object called FC 

TACfleet <- attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby[which(rownames(attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby)==as.character(thisY)),seq(1,ncol(attributes(FC[[1]])$catchby),3)]
TAC <- sum(TACfleet)

TACNSWB <- c(385008, 24528, 6659, 3150) # TAC given for herring in North Sea and western Baltic
#catch_all <- apply(catchthisY[,(ncol(catchthisY)-(sum(fitthisY$data$fleetTypes==0)-1)):ncol(catchthisY)],1,sum)
#prop_C <- catchthisY[(fitthisY$data$noYears-2):fitthisY$data$noYears,which(colnames(catchthisY)=="Obs(Fleet w.o. effort 3)")]
propWB_C <- 0.7284 # 3-year average split
propWB_D <- 0.3381 # 3-year average split
utiliz_C <- 0.50 # given by Pelagic RAC
utiliz_D <- 0.0547 # 3 years average utilization
options(scipen=999)
star.symbol='&#42;'
```

**Table: Catch constraint in the intermediate year `r thisY` (tonnes)**

`r star.symbol` 3-year average observed catch (`r fitthisY$data$years[(fitthisY$data$noYears-2)]`-`r fitthisY$data$years[fitthisY$data$noYears]`)

** 3-year average stock split in 3.a (`r fitthisY$data$years[(fitthisY$data$noYears-2)]`-`r fitthisY$data$years[fitthisY$data$noYears]`)

*** Given by the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council (RAC) or estimated asking fishers (transfer fraction used)

**** 3-year average utilization (`r fitthisY$data$years[(fitthisY$data$noYears-2)]`-`r fitthisY$data$years[fitthisY$data$noYears]`)


<span style="color:red"> VT: So in conclusion, the way the TAC is set for WBSS assumes that 50% of $TAC_{WBSS}$ is taken by the F-fleet, 41% is taken by the C-fleet and 9% is taken by the D-fleet in 3.a and A-fleet in 4.7E. If this is the correct interpretation of the TAC setting, looking at the Table above, we see that this is not currently the case. Assuming the fleet utilization, we have $TAC_{A_{WBSS}}$ = `r round(TACfleet[1]/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{C_{WBSS}}$ = `r round((utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2])/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{D_{WBSS}}$ = `r round((utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3])/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%, $TAC_{F_{WBSS}}$ = `r round(TACNSWB[4]/sum(TACfleet[1],utiliz_C*propWB_C*TACNSWB[2],utiliz_D*propWB_D*TACNSWB[3],TACNSWB[4])*100,1)`%.
I don't understand the rule $TAC_{WBSS}=2TAC_{22-24}$ when it is actually not the case. </span>
